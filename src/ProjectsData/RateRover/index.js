        `An application using React that leverages Java and JSX to facilitate currency conversion across different countries. 
        This project allowed me to enhance my React proficiency and gain hands-on experience in making API calls with external 
        websites and servers. Not only did this project provide me with an opportunity to improve my skills, but it also serves 
        a practical purpose and can benefit a broad range of users.`,
