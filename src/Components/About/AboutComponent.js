          Hello there! My name is Ahmad, and I attend Simon Fraser University to study computer science. 
          Web development, application development, and computer time complexity are some of my current 
          interests. I enjoy discovering new ideas and taking on challenging tasks.

          When I understood that technology was the best balancer, IÂ fell in love with it. It provides chances for the unfortunate, 
          a platform for everyone to connect, and a voice for individuals who lack one. As a result, I make it 
          a point to have an impact in whatever I do.

          I started off my watching a few youtube tutorials on HTML and CSS and got really excited about
          created my first website. I already knew the most of Javascript as I had learned it at school
          so I was ready to start my web development journey. Fast-forward a year I have learned HTML, CSS,
          Javascript, Java, Python, C, C++ and React. My journey is not over and I have still much too learn
          and I can not wait to see what is ahead of me.
