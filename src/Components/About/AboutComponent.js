              Hello there! My name is Ahmad, and I attend Simon Fraser University to study computer science. 
              Web development, application development, and computer time complexity are some of my current 
              interests. I enjoy discovering new ideas and taking on challenging tasks.

              When I understood that technology was the best balancer, IÂ fell in love with it. It provides chances for the unfortunate, 
              a platform for everyone to connect, and a voice for individuals who lack one. As a result, I make it 
              a point to have an impact in whatever I do.

              I started off my watching a few youtube tutorials on HTML and CSS and got really excited about
              created my first website. I already knew the most of Javascript as I had learned it at school
              so I was ready to start my web development journey. Fast-forward a year I have learned HTML, CSS,
              Javascript, Java, Python, C, C++ and React.
