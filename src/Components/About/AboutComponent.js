        Hello there! My name is Ahmad, and I attend Simon Fraser University to study computer science. 
        Web development, application development, and computer time complexity are some of my current 
        interests. I enjoy discovering new ideas and taking on challenging tasks.

        When I understood that technology was the best balancer, IÂ fell in love with it. It provides chances for the unfortunate, 
        a platform for everyone to connect, and a voice for individuals who lack one. As a result, I make it 
        a point to have an impact in whatever I do.
