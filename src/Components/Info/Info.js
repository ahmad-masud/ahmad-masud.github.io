          Hello! Ahmad here; I attend SFU and major in computer science. As a programmer, 
          I have worked on a wide range of projects using different technology stacks. Furthermore, 
          I have a lot of leadership experience from both my professional and extracurricular activities. 
          You can find me at the gym, hanging out with friends, or doing service for my community when 
          I'm not developing! If you have any inquires please feel free to check the about page or 
          head over to the contact page to send me an email.
