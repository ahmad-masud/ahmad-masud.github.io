            I study computer science and hope to work as a professional programmer someday. 
            I became interested in computers and science when my father gave me his old IBM laptop when 
            I was eight years old. Since then, as I apply the skills I've learned in school 
            to my extracurriculars, my own projects have continued to fuel my interest for computer programming. 
            I am a computer enthusiast that works hard and is outgoing and creative. 
            Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any questions or requests for me.
